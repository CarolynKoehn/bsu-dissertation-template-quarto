# Document abstract
abstract: |
  An _abstract_ is a brief summary of the document. A typical abstract provides a brief introduction, enough to provide context for the document, explains the purpose of the thesis or dissertation or project, and summarizes the major results and conclusions.  Keep in mind that a casual observer is likely to judge the content of the document by the abstract and title alone.  (There is an old adage: "in a joke, the punchline comes at the end; in a paper [or thesis], it comes in the abstract.")  A single concise paragraph usually suffices for the abstract.  If it spills onto a second page, it is probably too long.
# The Acknowledgments page is a place for the author to express thanks
# or generally acknowledge anyone or anything that assisted in the
# project or research.  If the student was supported even in part by
# funding from research grant, it needs to be acknowledged here.
# The Acknowledgments section can have multiple pages, just like the
# Abstract section, but like the abstract, more than one page is probably
# too long.  Acknowledgments are often written in the third person, but
# it is one place (the only place) in the document where first-person
# references (i.e., the use of "I") can be acceptable.
acknowledgements: | 
  Please include your acknowledgments here, set in a single paragraph. Please do not include any acknowledgments in the Supporting Information, or anywhere else in the manuscript.
# The work can be "dedicated" to someone, typically family members or
# someone similar.  Unlike acknowledgments, which are included in almost
# every thesis or dissertation or project, many students omit the dedication.
dedication: "dedicated to Wabi-sabi"
# A brief autobiographical sketch can be included.  Many students omit this.
# If it is included, remember that it is a sketch, so keep it brief.  Also
# try to limit the content to academically relevant material, such as under-
# graduate work, previous graduate work, employment, etc.  Some students
# like to include their military service.  Otherwise, unless you have
# overcome some particular adversity, it's probably better to leave out
# personal information.
biosketch: |
