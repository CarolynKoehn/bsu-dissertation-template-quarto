# Document abstract
abstract: |
  An _abstract_ is a brief summary of the document. A typical abstract provides a brief introduction, enough to provide context for the document, explains the purpose of the thesis or dissertation or project, and summarizes the major results and conclusions.  Keep in mind that a casual observer is likely to judge the content of the document by the abstract and title alone.  (There is an old adage: "in a joke, the punchline comes at the end; in a paper [or thesis], it comes in the abstract.")  A single concise paragraph usually suffices for the abstract.  If it spills onto a second page, it is probably too long.
# The Acknowledgments page is a place for the author to express thanks
# or generally acknowledge anyone or anything that assisted in the
# project or research.  If the student was supported even in part by
# funding from research grant, it needs to be acknowledged here.
# The Acknowledgments section can have multiple pages, just like the
# Abstract section, but like the abstract, more than one page is probably
# too long.  Acknowledgments are often written in the third person, but
# it is one place (the only place) in the document where first-person
# references (i.e., the use of "I") can be acceptable.
acknowledgements: | 
  Please include your acknowledgments here, set in a single paragraph. Please do not include any acknowledgments in the Supporting Information, or anywhere else in the manuscript.
# The work can be "dedicated" to someone, typically family members or
# someone similar.  Unlike acknowledgments, which are included in almost
# every thesis or dissertation or project, many students omit the dedication.
dedication: "dedicated to Wabi-sabi"
# A brief autobiographical sketch can be included.  Many students omit this.
# If it is included, remember that it is a sketch, so keep it brief.  Also
# try to limit the content to academically relevant material, such as under-
# graduate work, previous graduate work, employment, etc.  Some students
# like to include their military service.  Otherwise, unless you have
# overcome some particular adversity, it's probably better to leave out
# personal information.

% Chapter: Introduction
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

# Introduction {ch-intro}

<!-- % The {<tag>} command allows the chapter to be referenced elsewhere
% in the text by the <tag>: '@ch-intro' gets formatted as
% "Chapter 1" or whatever number this chapter gets assigned.  It usually
% requires a second 'latex' execution to get the labels right.  (The labels
% are stored in the ".aux" file, and that gets updated each time latex runs.) I am not sure about the behavior in Quarto yet.
%   Writers who use Quarto a lot are often in the habit of adding labels to
% chapter, figure, and table, then adding other labels to things like sections
% and subsections as they are needed.  Label tags follow no specific format,
% but it's typical to include a hyphen-terminated prefix to indicate what
% is being labeled, e.g. 'fig-' and 'tbl-' are required, see the Quarto crossrefs webpage for more info
%
%   ch-<name>  for chapters
%   sec-<name> for sections
%   tbl-<name> for tables
%   fig-<name> for figures
%
% WARNING: Do not use numbers or special characters such as '_', '$', etc.
%          in label tags (although '-' is okay). -->

## What is this?
This is a template that allows you to typeset your dissertation (or thesis or project report) in the format approved by the Boise State Graduate College. It greatly reduces your typesetting work and helps you produce an aesthetically pleasing and consistent document. The template depends on a style class, titled `bsu-cs.cls` that was specifically designed for Boise State Computer Science students but would also work for students from other departments.

### Where are the style class files?

<!-- % [@<tag>] is bibilography citation; <tag> must match a bibliography
% item label.  It can take multiple, comma-separated, arguments.

% The '~' is a "tie", which is an unbreakable space.  That is, it is
% the same a a space but TeX won't break the line there.  Ties are used
% between text and a reference or citation, to avoid something like Figure
% 1, which looks weird. -->

Please consult the guide from Graduate College~[@guide] for resolving any style issues
that are not addressed by the style class files that are provided along with this document. The
files associated with this style can be found on the GitHub website~[@mainrepo].

<!-- % `text` changes to "typewriter" (monospaced) font, which is typically
% used for literal code or filenames.
% _text_ italicizes the text -->

The file `bsu-cs.cls` contains the formatting directives for the _bsu-cs_ style. It is based on the standard LaTeX `report` style with 12 point font option.

**TO-DO:** Update this list relevant to Quarto

1. Simply copy `bsu-cs.cls` to the directory containing your \LaTeX\ document. That way, LaTeX will find it, because it looks in current directory by default.
2. Upload the `bsu-cs.cls` file along with this template (and associated files) to Overleaf to use web-based LaTeX.
3. The current style class file may be installed in some directory available system wide.  (Ask your systems administrator if this is the case).  You will have to include that directory in the path LaTeX uses to search for input files.  Under Linux, this is controlled by the `TEXINPUTS` environment variable, which can be set in the `.bashrc` file in your home directory.
For example

`TEXINPUTS=.:/usr/local/texinputs/:/usr/share/texmf//`
`export TEXINPUTS`

adds `/usr/local/texinputs`, a possible location for `bsu-cs.cls`, although it will not take effect until you `source` the `.bashrc` file, or log in again.
4. Install the style class files in a directory under your accounts and set the `TEXINPUTS`
variable accordingly.

<!-- % If you have blank lines before  or after the numbered list
% it makes the code easier to read, but it also
% starts a new paragraph.  You can always use empty comments for readablilty.
%
% Although, you can always use \noindent to prevent paragraph indentation. -->

The first or second way is recommended, because they involve making a local copy of the style
file. This assures your document format will not be affected affected by subsequent updates
to `bsu-cs.cls` (but gives you the option to copy the updated file if you want).

## Get ready for Wabi-sabi {sec-getReady}

<!-- % The [^1] command creates a footnote -->
So who is Wabi-sabi? We need a lot of text in here to see what happens when we hit the bottom of
a page with text and try out things like footnotes [^1]. So here is some extra stuff: [^2]

[^1]: What's not to like about footnotes, anyway?  Brian O'Nolan and George MacDonald Fraser both used them to great effect.

[^2]: Too many footnotes, however, can be distracting.

We need lots more stuff to get a full page of text, without a chapter or section heading,
so we can check all the margins.

# The Greatness of Wabi-sabi {ch-wabisabiGreatness}

## Previous work
The greatness of Wabi-sabi The Great derives from her early work as documented in
her books~[@ws:book1,ws:book2].

\section{What are their names?}
Please consult the articles by Admirer~\cite{me:paper1} and Admirer, Smith and Doe~\cite{me:paper2}
for more details. Note that the references are cited by the last names of all authors for three
authors or less. For more than three authors, ``et al'' can be used.

%! The \label command applies to the most recent heading in the main text,
%! or the current figure or table.
%! The \pageref{<tag>} command references the page number of a label.
Check the References on page~\pageref{references} for an example of how to format the references.

\section{The code of Wabi-sabi}

% \textbf{} sets text in bold face.  It is useful in headings, but
% is rarely used in running text.  It is used here to denote literal
% LaTeX commands, and to illustrate its use.  Normally it is preferable
% to use \emph{} to emphasize text.
When showing a program fragment, use the \textbf{verbatim} environment. However, when you wan
to show an algorithm, use either the \textbf{tabbing} or \textbf{algorithm} environment.

Thesis and dissertation text is normally ``double'' spaced.  It is customary to single-space
literal code.  Figure~\ref{fig:code} shows a sample Java program.

% The 'figure' environment starts a new figure, which is a type of
% "floating" element.  That means it goes where LaTeX decides to put it,
% rather than at the current point in the running text.  Don't be surprised
% when figures and tables get placed in unexpected places.
%
% You can control, to some degree, where floating elements go by setting
% the optional argument of \begin{figure}.  The options are
%
%   h - place the figure at this point, if possible (avoid this)
%   t - place the figure at the top of a page
%   b - place the figure at the bottom of a page
%   p - place the figure on a special page containing only figures and tables
%
% The options can be combined, and a '*' can be appended to make LaTeX
% try harder to match the request.  For example, \begin{figure}[tp*]
% allows the figure to be placed at the top of the page or on a special
% page ([tp*] is in fact the default set in "bsu-cs.cls").  Avoid using
% [h] by itself--it is inflexible and can cause formatting problems.  At
% the same time, it can be very useful in forcing figure placement.
% Finessing figure placement is a typesetting task that you just have to get
% used to, no matter what system you are using.
%
% WARNING: when LaTeX has trouble placing floating elements, it sometimes
%          puts all of them at the very end of the document.  So if your
%          figures and tables suddenly disappear, check the end of the
%          document.  Adding more 'p' specifiers can help with this.

\begin{figure}[t]

\begin{vcode}
% an alternative to 'singlespace', that also shrinks the
% typewriter font so that it blends better with the text
\begin{lstlisting}
/**
Compute x^n using recursive doubling technique. O(lg n) multiplications.
@param x  The base value, unlimited precision.
@param n  The exponent, an integer.
@return   The computed power as a BigInteger
*/
public static BigInteger power(BigInteger x, int n)
{
    BigInteger temp = x;
    BigInteger result = BigInteger.ONE;
	while (n != 0) {
        if ((n & 1) == 1)
            result = result.multiply(temp);
		if ((n = n >>>1) != 0)
           	temp = temp.multiply(temp);
    }
    return result;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{vcode}
%\caption{} gives the figure or table a caption, which is normally
% placed below the figure (but above a table).  The caption is also
% used as the title of the figure in the list of figures.  An optional
% argument gives the figure a "short title" for use in the list of
% figures, which is useful if the caption is long, or includes some
% extra information.
\caption[Repeated Squaring Power Method]{Repeated Squaring Power Method. This figure
also serves as an example of the inclusion of literal code.}

% WARNING: the labels can get screwed up if the label in a figure is given

\section{Other mysteries of Wabi-sabi}

Here is an itemized list of all the mysteries of Wabi-sabi.
% The 'itemize' environment is for unordered lists: the items are bulleted
% rather than numbered.  A different bullet style is used for itemized
% lists inside itemized lists.
\begin{itemize}
\item Mystery 1.
\item Mystery 2.
\item Mystery 3.
\item Mystery 4.
\end{itemize}

% Tables are like figures, except that they are numbered separately
% and the caption is placed at the top.  Also there is a separate
% list of tables in the front matter.

Here is a simple table.

\begin{table}[ht] % 'h' in this case prevents the table from being placed
                 % too close to the figure
% By custom, the caption of a table is placed at the top of the table.
\caption{The Approximate Time of Parallelizing Each Code}
% (The label must follow the caption)
\label{table4}
\centering % tables need be horizontally centered
% The 'tabular' environment can be used to format tables.  Unfortunately
% it is one of the more cumbersome LaTeX constructs.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline \hline
Parallel library/language  &WRS Code  &OCS Code  &ICSAMD Code\\ \hline
MPI                        &20 hours  &2 weeks   &1 month\\ \hline
