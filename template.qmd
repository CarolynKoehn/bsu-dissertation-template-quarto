# Document abstract
abstract: |
  An _abstract_ is a brief summary of the document. A typical abstract provides a brief introduction, enough to provide context for the document, explains the purpose of the thesis or dissertation or project, and summarizes the major results and conclusions.  Keep in mind that a casual observer is likely to judge the content of the document by the abstract and title alone.  (There is an old adage: "in a joke, the punchline comes at the end; in a paper [or thesis], it comes in the abstract.")  A single concise paragraph usually suffices for the abstract.  If it spills onto a second page, it is probably too long.
# The Acknowledgments page is a place for the author to express thanks
# or generally acknowledge anyone or anything that assisted in the
# project or research.  If the student was supported even in part by
# funding from research grant, it needs to be acknowledged here.
# The Acknowledgments section can have multiple pages, just like the
# Abstract section, but like the abstract, more than one page is probably
# too long.  Acknowledgments are often written in the third person, but
# it is one place (the only place) in the document where first-person
# references (i.e., the use of "I") can be acceptable.
acknowledgments: |
  The author wishes to express gratitude to Wabi-sabi.  This work would have been partially supported by some particular grant, if there was one.
# The work can be "dedicated" to someone, typically family members or
# someone similar.  Unlike acknowledgments, which are included in almost
# every thesis or dissertation or project, many students omit the dedication.
dedication: "dedicated to Wabi-sabi"
# A brief autobiographical sketch can be included.  Many students omit this.
# If it is included, remember that it is a sketch, so keep it brief.  Also
# try to limit the content to academically relevant material, such as under-
# graduate work, previous graduate work, employment, etc.  Some students
# like to include their military service.  Otherwise, unless you have
# overcome some particular adversity, it's probably better to leave out
# personal information.

  Wabi-sabi Admirer was born admiring Wabi-sabi. Wabi-sabi Admirer has been tinkering with admiration of Wabi-sabi for a long time. Now it is time to be blessed by Wabi-sabi.

<!-- LaTeX code is needed for correct chapter heading formatting -->

\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch-intro}

<!-- % The {<tag>} command allows the chapter to be referenced elsewhere
% in the text by the <tag>: '@sec-intro' gets formatted as
% "Chapter 1" or whatever number this chapter gets assigned.  It usually
% requires a second 'latex' execution to get the labels right.  (The labels
% are stored in the ".aux" file, and that gets updated each time latex runs.) I am not sure about the behavior in Quarto yet.
%   Writers who use Quarto a lot are often in the habit of adding labels to
% chapter, figure, and table, then adding other labels to things like sections
% and subsections as they are needed.  Label tags follow no specific format,
% but it's typical to include a hyphen-terminated prefix to indicate what
% is being labeled, e.g. 'fig-' and 'tbl-' are required, see the Quarto crossrefs webpage for more info
%
%   sec-<name> for sections
%   tbl-<name> for tables
%   fig-<name> for figures
%
% WARNING: Do not use numbers or special characters such as '_', '$', etc.
%          in label tags (although '-' is okay). -->

<!-- Quarto headings start after the chapter heading -->
# What is this?
This is a template that allows you to typeset your dissertation (or thesis or project report) in the format approved by the Boise State Graduate College. It greatly reduces your typesetting work and helps you produce an aesthetically pleasing and consistent document. The template depends on a style class, titled `bsu-cs.cls` that was specifically designed for Boise State Computer Science students but would also work for students from other departments.

## Where are the style class files?

<!-- % [@<tag>] is bibilography citation; <tag> must match a bibliography
% item label.  It can take multiple, comma-separated, arguments. -->

Please consult the guide from Graduate College [@guide] for resolving any style issues
that are not addressed by the style class files that are provided along with this document. The files associated with this style can be found on the GitHub website [@mainrepo].

<!-- % `text` changes to "typewriter" (monospaced) font, which is typically
% used for literal code or filenames.
% _text_ italicizes the text -->

The file `bsu-cs.cls` contains the formatting directives for the _bsu-cs_ style. It is based on the standard LaTeX `report` style with 12 point font option.

**TO-DO:** Update this list relevant to Quarto

1. Simply copy `bsu-cs.cls` to the directory containing your \LaTeX\ document. That way, LaTeX will find it, because it looks in current directory by default.
2. Upload the `bsu-cs.cls` file along with this template (and associated files) to Overleaf to use web-based LaTeX.
3. The current style class file may be installed in some directory available system wide.  (Ask your systems administrator if this is the case).  You will have to include that directory in the path LaTeX uses to search for input files.  Under Linux, this is controlled by the `TEXINPUTS` environment variable, which can be set in the `.bashrc` file in your home directory.
For example

`TEXINPUTS=.:/usr/local/texinputs/:/usr/share/texmf//`
`export TEXINPUTS`

adds `/usr/local/texinputs`, a possible location for `bsu-cs.cls`, although it will not take effect until you `source` the `.bashrc` file, or log in again.
4. Install the style class files in a directory under your accounts and set the `TEXINPUTS`
variable accordingly.

<!-- % If you have blank lines before  or after the numbered list
% it makes the code easier to read, but it also
% starts a new paragraph.  You can always use empty comments for readablilty.
%
% Although, you can always use \noindent to prevent paragraph indentation. -->

The first or second way is recommended, because they involve making a local copy of the style
file. This assures your document format will not be affected affected by subsequent updates
to `bsu-cs.cls` (but gives you the option to copy the updated file if you want).

# Get ready for Wabi-sabi {#sec-getReady}

<!-- % The [^1] command creates a footnote -->
So who is Wabi-sabi? We need a lot of text in here to see what happens when we hit the bottom of
a page with text and try out things like footnotes [^1]. So here is some extra stuff: [^2]

[^1]: What's not to like about footnotes, anyway?  Brian O'Nolan and George MacDonald Fraser both used them to great effect.

[^2]: Too many footnotes, however, can be distracting.

so we can check all the margins.

\chapter{The Greatness of Wabi-sabi} \label{ch-wabisabiGreatness}

# Previous work
The greatness of Wabi-sabi The Great derives from her early work as documented in her books [@wsbook1; @wsbook2].

# What are their names?
Please consult the articles by Admirer [@mepaper1] and Admirer, Smith and Doe [@mepaper2] for more details. Note that the references are cited by the last names of all authors for three authors or less. For more than three authors, "et al" can be used.

<!-- %! The \pageref{<tag>} command references the page number of a label. -->
Check the References on page \pageref{refs} for an example of how to format the references.

# The code of Wabi-sabi

<!-- % **text** sets text in bold face.  It is useful in headings, but
% is rarely used in running text.  It is used here to denote literal
% LaTeX commands, and to illustrate its use. 
When showing a program fragment, use the `text` environment. However, when you want
to show an algorithm, use the $text$ environment. -->

Thesis and dissertation text is normally "double spaced."  It is customary to single-space
literal code.  @fig-code shows a sample Java program.

<!-- fig-scap is used to assign a short figure title for the table of contents -->
